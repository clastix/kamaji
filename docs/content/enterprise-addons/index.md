# Enterprise Addons

This document contains the documentation of the available Kamaji addons. 

## What is a Kamaji Addon

A Kamaji Addon is a separate component installed in the same Kamaji cluster.
It offers an additional set of features required for enterprise-grade usage.

The developed Kamaji addons are closed-source available and work with the upstream Kamaji edition.

## Distribution of Addons

The Kamaji Addons are available behind an active [subscription license](https://clastix.io/support/).

Once a subscription is activated, the [CLASTIX](https://clastix.io) team will automate the push of required OCI (container images) and Helm Chart artefacts to the customer's OCI-compatible repository.

## Available addons
