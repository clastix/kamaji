# Use Cases
Kamaji project has been initially started as a solution for actual and common problems such as minimizing the Total Cost of Ownership while running Kubernetes at large scale. However, it can open a wider range of use cases.

Here are a few:

- **Managed Kubernetes:** enable companies to provide Cloud Native Infrastructure with ease by introducing a strong separation of concerns between management and workloads. Centralize clusters management, monitoring, and observability by leaving developers to focus on applications, increase productivity and reduce operational costs.
- **Kubernetes as a Service:** provide Kubernetes clusters in a self-service fashion by running management and workloads on different infrastructures with the option of Bring Your Own Device, BYOD.
- **Control Plane as a Service:** provide multiple Kubernetes control planes running on top of a single Kubernetes cluster. Tenants who use namespaces based isolation often still need access to cluster wide resources like Cluster Roles, Admission Webhooks, or Custom Resource Definitions.
- **Edge Computing:** distribute Kubernetes workloads across edge computing locations without having to manage multiple clusters across various providers. Centralize management of hundreds of control planes while leaving workloads to run isolated on their own dedicated infrastructure.
- **Cluster Simulation:** check new Kubernetes API or experimental flag or a new tool without impacting production operations. Kamaji will let you simulate such things in a safe and controlled environment.
- **Workloads Testing:** check the behaviour of your workloads on different and multiple versions of Kubernetes with ease by deploying multiple Control Planes in a single cluster.
