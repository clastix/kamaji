# Cluster APIs Support

The [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) brings declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs to creation of Kubernetes clusters, including configuration and management.

Kamaji offers seamless integration with the most popular Cluster API Infrastructure Providers. Check the currently supported providers and the roadmap on the related [reposistory](https://github.com/clastix/cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji).
