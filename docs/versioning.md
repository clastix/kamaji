# Versioning and support
In Kamaji, there are different components that might require independent versioning and support level:

|Kamaji|Admin Cluster|Tenant Cluster (min)|Tenant Cluster (max)|Konnectivity|Tenant etcd |
|------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|------------|
|0.0.1 |1.22.0+      |1.21.0              |1.23.x              |0.0.32      |3.5.4       | 

Other combinations might work but have not been tested.
