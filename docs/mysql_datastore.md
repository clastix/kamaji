# MySQL as Kubernetes Storage

Kamaji offers the possibility of having a different storage system than `ETCD` thanks to [kine](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine) integration. One of the implementations is [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).

> A detailed guide for production setup will be released soon. Please refer to [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started-with-kamaji.md) for a demo setup with KinD.
