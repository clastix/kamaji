### ü§î What is Kamaji?

**Kamaji** is a **Kubernetes Control Plane Manager** leveraging on the concept of [**Hosted Control Plane**](https://clastix.io/post/the-raise-of-hosted-control-plane-in-kubernetes/).

Kamaji's approach is based on running the Kubernetes Control Plane components in Pods instead of dedicated machines.
This allows operating Kubernetes clusters at scale, with a fraction of the operational burden.
Thanks to this approach, running multiple Control Planes can be cheaper and easier to deploy and operate.

_Kamaji is like a fleet of Site Reliability Engineers with expertise codified into its logic, working 24/7 to keep up and running your Control Planes._

### üìñ How it works

Kamaji is extending the Kubernetes API capabilities thanks to [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions).

By installing Kamaji, two pairs of new APIs will be available:

- `TenantControlPlane`, the instance definition of your desired Kubernetes Control Plane
- `Datastore`, the backing store used by one (or more) `TenantControlPlane`

The `TenantControlPlane` (short-named as `tcp`) objects are Namespace-scoped and allows configuring every aspect of your desired Control Plane.
Besides the Kubernetes configuration values, you can specify the Pod options such as limit, request, tolerations, node selector, etc.,
as well as how these should be exposed (e.g.: using a `ClusterIP`, a `LoadBalancer`, or a `NodePort`).

The `TenantControlPlane` is the stateless definition of the Control Plane allowing to set up the required components for a full-fledged Kubernetest cluster.
The state is managed by the `Datastore` API, a cluster-scoped resource which can hold the data of one or more Kubernetes clusters.

> For further information about the API specifications and all the available options,
> refer to the official [API reference](https://kamaji.clastix.io/reference/api/#tenantcontrolplane).

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Main features

- **Fast provisioning time**: depending on the infrastructure, Tenant Control Planes are up and ready to serve traffic in **16 seconds**.
- **Streamlined update**: the rollout to a new Kubernetes version for a given Tenant Control Plane takes just **10 seconds**, with a Blue/Green deployment to avoid serving mixed Kubernetes versions.
- **Resource optimization**: thanks to the Datastore decoupling, there's no need of odd number instances (e.g.: RAFT consensus) by allowing to save up to 60% of HW resources.
- **Scale from zero to the moon**: scale down the instance when there's no usage, or automatically scale to support the traffic spikes reusing the Kubernetes patterns.
- **Declarative approach, constant reconciliation**: thanks to the Operator pattern, drift detection happens in real-time, maintaining the desired state.
- **Automated certificates management**: Kamaji leverages on `kubeadm` and the certificates are automatically created and rotated for you.
- **Managing core addons**: Kamaji allows configuring automatically `kube-proxy`, `CoreDNS`, and `konnectivity`, with automatic remediation in case of user errors (e.g.: deleting the `CoreDNS` deployment).
- **Auto Healing**: the `TenantControlPlane` objects in the management cluster are tracked by Kamaji, in case of deletion of those, everything is created in an idempotent way.
- **Datastore multi-tenancy**: optionally, Kamaji allows running multiple Control Planes on the same _Datastore_ instance leveraging on the multi-tenancy of each driver, decreasing operations and optimizing costs.
- **Overcoming `etcd` limitations**: optionally, Kamaji allows using a different _Datastore_ thanks to [`kine`](https://github.com/k3s-io/kine) by supporting `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, or `NATS` as an alternative.
- **Simplifying mixed-networks setup**: thanks to [`Konnectivity`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/setup-konnectivity/),
  the Tenant Control Plane is connected to the worker nodes hosted in a different network, overcoming the no-NAT availability when dealing with nodes with a non routable IP address
  (e.g.: worker nodes in a different infrastructure).

### üöÄ Use cases

- [**Creating a private Managed Kubernetes Service**](https://clastix.io/post/netsons-builds-a-managed-kubernetes-service-with-kamaji-and-open-stack/)
- [**Building a Platform as a Service**](https://aenix.io/cozystack/)
- [**Overcoming public Managed Kubernetes Services**](https://clastix.io/post/overcoming-eks-limitations-with-kamaji-on-aws/) such as EKS
- [**Hybrid infrastructures**](https://clastix.io/post/bridging-the-gap-hybrid-kubernetes-clusters-with-remote-control-planes/):
  host the Control Plane on the Cloud and worker nodes on prem or vice-versa, according to your needs.
- [**Kubernetes at the edge**](https://clastix.io/post/edgevolution-unleashing-the-power-of-kubernetes-clusters-for-a-revolutionary-edge-computing-experience/):
  take full advantage of the _Kubernetes API Server as a service_ paradigm.
- **Kubernetes Control Plane as a Service:** centrally manage multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single management point (_Multi-Cluster management_). 
- **High-density Control Plane:** place multiple control planes on the same infrastructure, instead of having dedicated machines for each control plane.
- **Strong Multi-tenancy:** leave users to access the control plane with admin permissions while keeping them isolated at the infrastructure level.
- **Kubernetes Inception:** use Kubernetes to manage Kubernetes with automation, high-availability, fault tolerance, and autoscaling out of the box. 
- **Bring Your Own Device:** keep the control plane isolated from data plane. Worker nodes can join and run consistently from everywhere: cloud, edge, and data-center.
- **Full CNCF compliant:** all clusters are built with upstream Kubernetes binaries, resulting in full CNCF compliant Kubernetes clusters.

### üç¶ Vanilla Kubernetes clusters

Kamaji is **not** yet-another-Kubernetes distribution: you have full freedom on the technology stack to provide to end users.
Kamaji is a perfect fit for Platform Engineering, hiding the complexity of the Control Plane management to developers and DevOps engineers.

The provided Kubernetes Control Planes are [CNCF compliant clusters](https://kamaji.clastix.io/reference/conformance/).

### üê¢ Cluster API support

Kamaji is **not** a [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) replacement, rather, it plays very well with it.

Since Kamaji is just focusing on the Control Plane a [Kamaji's Cluster API Control Plane provider](https://github.com/clastix/cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji) has been developed.
