**Kamaji** is a **Kubernetes Control Plane Manager**. It operates Kubernetes at scale with a fraction of the operational burden. Kamaji is special because the Control Plane components are running inside pods instead of dedicated machines. This solution makes running multiple Control Planes cheaper and easier to deploy and operate.

## Main Features

- **Multi-cluster Management:** centrally manage multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single Management Cluster. 
- **High-density Control Plane:** place multiple control planes on the same infrastructure, instead of having dedicated machines for each control plane.
- **Strong Multi-tenancy:** leave users to access the control plane with admin permissions while keeping them isolated at the infrastructure level.
- **Kubernetes Inception:** use Kubernetes to manage Kubernetes with automation, high-availability, fault tolerance, and autoscaling out of the box. 
- **Bring Your Own Device:** keep the control plane isolated from data plane. Worke nodes can join and run consistently everywhere: cloud, edge, and data-center.
- **Full CNCF compliant:** all clusters are built with upstream Kubernetes binaries, resulting in full CNCF compliant Kubernetes clusters.
